# ISOM 670: Business Statistics
> This course is a refresher and a new look at how statistical methods begin the process of understanding
and describing data. We will use r/rstudio to review basic data exploration and statistical methods. The
course will be very hands on and practical, working with real world data. We will cover topics from simple
descriptive statistics like (mean/variance) up though hypothesis testing and modeling. The tools and
techniques in the class will be fundamental to all following classes.
